#Flow for github 

1. $ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
2. $ git push -u origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
3. Make changes on branch
4. Add changes, commit to branch
5. git pull/ git push for changes made on the branch only
6. Periodically $ git pull --rebase origin master
	- this pulls in changes from master to your branch 
	- helps you develop on an up-to-date master branch
7. When you are ready to push your branch to master 
	- do step #6 again
	- make sure your changes still work
	- $ git checkout master
	- $ git merge [name_of_your_new_branch]
